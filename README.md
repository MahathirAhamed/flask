Introduction
---
This is a simple application for [_Online Dagboek_](http://www.online-dagboek.nl/).
Users can write down private stuff and save it in this diary. Noone else can read your
posts, only yourself.

It's build on [Python](http://www.python.org/) with [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)
and some other packages (see requirements.txt).
